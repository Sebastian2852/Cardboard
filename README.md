# Cardboard

A really bad 2d game engine :P

## Usage

Cardboard comes with a sample `Game` project which you can use to see how it works.

## Building

This project uses [Premake](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/) as the build system.

There is a single `premake5.lua` file in charge of building everything. Simply run

```sh
premake vs2022
```

to generate visual studio projects. If you need a different type of project see [here](https://premake.github.io/docs/Using-Premake).
